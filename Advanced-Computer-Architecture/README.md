# Advanced-Computer-Architecture

My solutions for Advanced Computer Architecture course in ECE,NTUA.

<b>Lab 1</b> - We had to carry out a series of measurements in order to estimate Ï„he effect of the most important parameters of the memory hierarchy on performance.

<b>Lab 2</b> - Creation of branch predictors

<b>Lab 3</b> - In this exercise we were asked to study the effect of the dispatch_width (dw) parameter, which refers to the plurality of the commands being issued simultaneously in our processor, and of the window_size (ws), i.e. the size of the ROB (re-order buffer).

<b>Lab 4</b> - The purpose of this lab was to run a series of metrics in order to estimate the effect of different sync mechanisms on multi-core systems.

Tools that were used: Sniper Multicore Simulator, PIN and a number of benchmarks.
