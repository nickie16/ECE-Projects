<h1>ECE Projects </h1>

<h2> Algorithms </h2>

My answers for the programming excercises in Algorithms course, of ECE/NTUA.

<h2> Artificial Intelligence </h2>

Project on Artificial Intelligence in Java which purpose was to conduct two virtual robots through a 2D map from 2
different starting points to a goal point while avoiding crash among them and with other obstacles. We used A\* algorithm.

In order to test it you can use any of the input files available. 
You can run it by typing: <h4><i> java Main path/to/input_file option </i></h4>  where option can be messages or map.

First option is mostly for debugging purposes while in the second you can see a map with the routes that the two robots are following.
The Path for robot1 is colored red, for the robot2 is yellow, while the positions that are crossed by both robots are marked purple.
Starting points for the two robots appearing in the map with the letter 'S' for the first one and with 'Σ' for the second, all meeting points are appearing with the letter 'M'. Target position is marked as 'Τ'.

<h2> Databases </h2>

Development of a MySQL Base for a loan system, made for the needs of ECE,NTUA course. 

The base supports insert, delete and update operations in every matrix as well as 10 complex queries. 
Triggers were also used in order to automate a lot of the operations needed. 
For example when all the requirements for giving a new loan are met, automatically we update all matrices
where necessary. 

For the implementation of the base we used the tools WAMP and phpmyadmin. 
The base uses a web interface implemented in html for easyaccess. 
PHP was used to connect html with SQL.

My part of the job was everything related with the SQL.

In order to use you should have installed WAMP server. Put contents of final directory in www directory of WAMP server. 
Import the sql file in phpmyadmin. Set the server online and the project must be accesible through the localhost.

<b>Lab 1 </b> In this exercise we implemented a program which writes to an output file the contents of two input files using file descriptors.

<b>Lab 2 </b> 1.1/1.2 - Creation of a specific and an arbitrary process tree. 1.3 - Sending and handling signals.  1.4 - Parallel calculation of arithmetic expression

<b>Lab 3 </b> 1.1 - In this exercise we were asked to synchronize an existing code. 1.2 - Parallel calculation of Mandelbrot set.

<b>Lab 4 </b> 1.1 Implementation of a round-robin scheduler on the user space 1.2 - Controlling the operation of scheduler through a shell. 
1.3 - Priorities in scheduler.

<b>Cgroups</b> In this exercise we had to develop two scripts that are being used by the deamon cgmond.<br>
The <b>cgmon_policy</b> takes as input the name of a new process as well as the amount of the cpu that would like to use.
It returns a positive number that represents the units that a process gets or a negative number if there is no 
possible way to quarante a certain number of units for this process.
The task of <b>cgmon_limit</b> is to implement the settings that the previous script demanded.
